<h3> Agent Based Model 1 </h3>
<p>
  I have developed a Agent based model in which Agents walk around and eat the enivronment in a random direction. Functions include eating the environment and throwing up if they have eaten too much and sharing their resources with neighboroughs. Please follow the link below to Acsess the GitHub Repository for my Model. The Repository includes a Read me file, licensing file and relevant files needed to run the model.
