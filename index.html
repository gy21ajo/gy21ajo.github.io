<h3> Agent Based Model 1 </h3>
<p id="Agent1">
  I have developed a Agent based model in which Agents interact with a environment. Functions include:
 - Move around the environment in a random way
 - eating the environment and throwing up if they have eaten too much 
 - sharing their resources with  with neighbours, or if they have not eaten enough stealing all their neighbours resorces. 
 - 'Wolfs' walk around the environment and identify if they would eat the agents
 - Display the output animated on a GUI
 
 More information is available on the Readme.txt file.

 <h3> Future Development </h3>
 <p 
    Future development would include completing the wolf-agent interaction. So far the distance between wolfs and agents is calculated. If there distance is the same as the neighborhood then Eat is written in a text file. Ideally the agent would be removed from the list if eaten.
