<h3> Agent Based Model 1 </h3>

  I have developed a Agent based model in which Agents interact with a environment. More information is available on the Readme.txt file. Functions include: <br>
 - Move around the environment in a random way <br>
 - eating the environment and throwing up if they have eaten too much <br>
 - sharing their resources with  with neighbours, or if they have not eaten enough stealing all their neighbours resorces. <br>
 - 'Wolfs' walk around the environment and identify if they would eat the agents. <br>
 - Display the output animated on a GUI. <br>
   
 </p>
  <h4> Future Development </h4>
 <p> Future development would include completing the wolf-agent interaction. So far the distance between wolfs and agents is calculated. If there distance is the same as the neighborhood then Eat is written in a text file. Ideally the agent would be removed from the list if eaten.
