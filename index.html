<h2>Agent Based Modelling</h2>
  
<BODY>
I am Student studying Msc River Basin Management at the Universtiy of Leeds curently developing my python skills. 
I have developed a Agent based model in which Agents walk around and eat the enivronment in a random direction. Functions include eating the environment and throwing up if they have eaten too much
and also sharing their resources with neighboroughs. Please follow the link below to Acsess the Repository for my Model.
